If each block executes based on whether all its inputs are met, we have the following possible features:
- Blocks could arbitrarily generate outputs and be more complicated

Disadvantages:
- Scheduler is more complicated and has to handle arbitrary generators
- Dependencies between time-based dependencies is harder to express (draw a line between blocks even though no input is passed?)
- Time based sequences are hard to express and are important for games

If we use semi-synchronous dataflow with time based scheduling constraints (block A must fire before block B):
- Scheduler is a lot simpler (can be reduced to a single schedule)
- Time based sequences are easier to express
- Easier to use and understand coming from normal programming languages
